<Section title="Description">

Designed for the Plaza cinema, it features modular wooden cubes, each featuring small openings that reveal film excerpts on embedded screens, the installation encourages curiosity-driven exploration. The selected scenes focus on introspective moments, where characters are immersed in thought. However, when a viewer comes too close, the characters acknowledge their presence—pausing their actions and staring directly at the spectator. The result is an unsettling yet thought-provoking experience that blurs the line between observer and observed.

By transforming passive viewing into a responsive exchange, Caught Watching prompt visitors to reflect on cinema’s voyeuristic nature and their own relationship with on-screen narratives.
