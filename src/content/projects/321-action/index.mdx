<Section title="Description">

Step into the unknown! 3 2 1 Action invites participants to perform scenes from famous movies—without any prior knowledge of what they are acting out. Using minimal prompts, gestures, and props, players reenact cinematic moments while a real-time system captures their movements. The results? Unexpected, hilarious, and sometimes eerily accurate performances.

After the session, the recorded footage can be transformed into a Phonotrope, a mesmerizing animated loop that brings the scenes to life in a unique way.

This installation celebrates spontaneity, the magic of film, and the playful joy of performing in front of an audience—even if you don’t know the script!
